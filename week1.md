# Week 1 Notes

## What is NLP
- Language understanding is AI complete.

## What is Deep Learning?
- DL is a subset of Machine Learning
- DL vs. ML
  - ML is 90% handpicking features + 10% learning
  - DL is about automatically learning features given raw inputs (eg: words, pixels..)
  
## Why learn DL?
  - Learned features vs. handcrafting features in ML
  - Learns from both unsupervised and supervised data
  - Improved performance, thanks to advances in hardware, tons of data and cutting edge algorithms
  
## Why is NLP hard?
- Language is ambiguous. Needs lot of signals like context, visuals, situations etc. to get complete meaning.
